# Spraak en Gebarenherkenning (Speech & Gesture Recognition) materials
Materials for the practical sessions of the UvA course Spraak- en Gebarenherkenning (Speech &amp; Gesture Recognition). The format is a Jupyter notebook running Python 3, with basic sections of code filled out, along with missing sections that students need to complete themselves, as well as DIY sections at the end, where students must apply the models/methods in a new way to further explore outcomes and possibilities. These DIY sections also include open questions for the students to pursue. For tutorials with large sections that students must complete themselves, there will be a second version of the .ipynb file, marked as *_solved.ipynb, which contains some example worked solutions.

As of 2026, the practical sections of the course cover:
- Training and implementing an n-gram model for surprisal and next-word entropy calculation (week 1)
- Training and implementing a basic emotion recognizer model for speech (week 2)
- Utilizing computer-vision based gesture recognition: possibilities and shortcomings (week 3)
